# Social Finance, Inc. (commonly known as SoFi)

## Overview and Origin

The banking industry has never seen more disruption—new, innovative challengers and advanced technologies are changing market structure and taking a bite out of revenues. In fact, 17 percent of industry players that entered banking over the last 13 years have grabbed one-third of revenue growth in Europe. For incumbents, the time to act is now.

* Name of company

	Social Finance, Inc. (commonly known as SoFi)

* When was the company incorporated?

	It was founded in August 2011.

* Who are the founders of the company?

	The founders are Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan, and Ian Brady.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

	SoFi was founded in 2011 by Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan, and Ian Brady, four students who met at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. The founders hoped SoFi could provide more affordable options for those taking on debt to fund their education.[1]

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

	The company's inaugural loan program was a $2 million pilot at Stanford. For this pilot, 40 alumni invested an average of $20,000 to 100 students.[1][2][3]


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

	According to Cagney, “The current student loan market is unsustainable.”

	By raising funds from successful alumni in 40 schools around the country, SoFi is lowering the rate that students pay on their loans, creating high yielding investments for the alumni, and boosting the odds that those alumni will help the students find jobs.

	A key advantage of SoFi’s programs is that it creates a single organization that succeeds only if the students and their lenders are better off.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  
	
	Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

	SoFi’s program is the brainchild of ﻿﻿Mike Cagney, SoFi co-founder and CEO, who was formerly vice president and head trader of Wells Fargo (WFC). Cagney saw an opportunity to lower the rates that students pay on their loans while creating an attractive investment opportunity for alumni. One of the clever aspects of this model is that it matches up the providers of the funds with their borrowers on a school-by-school basis.

	SoFi started at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business in the Fall of 2011, raising and lending out roughly $2 million. SoFi’s pilot community matched 40 alumni and roughly 100 students.

	Ben Kessler, an MBA student and a SoFi loan borrower, said a combination of SoFi’s affordable rate and unique form of access to the school’s alumni set the program apart. “The SoFi application process was easy and its loans are among the best on the market,” he said. “In addition, I have received some great practical advice from alumni investors who have a direct economic interest in my success.” 

	And Roosevelt says that his growing sales force of alumni from the business schools at Stanford, Harvard, and Wharton is helping to spread SoFi to the top business school campuses in the U.S.

	If it can consistently fulfill its promise of making alumni lenders, student borrowers, and their host universities better off, SoFi should gain a hefty share of that $1 trillion student loan market.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

	SoFi originally utilized an alumni-funded lending model that connected students and recent graduates with alumni and institutional investors via school specific student loan funds. ("A new way to crowdsource your student loans". MSN Money. 26 July 2013. Archived from the original on 31 August 2013. Retrieved 24 March 2015.)
	
	Investors received a financial return and borrowers received rates lower than the federal government offered. The company sought to minimize defaults by focusing on low-risk students and graduates. ("Harvard Graduates Targeted by Alumni-Backed Loan Funds". Bloomberg. 11 December 2012.)
	
	As SoFi's product offerings expanded to include mortgages, mortgage refinancing and personal loans, the company moved away from an alumni-funded model to a non-traditional underwriting approach focused on lending to financially responsible individuals. SoFi uses an underwriting model that examines free cash flow, professional history and education in addition to a history of responsible bill payment to evaluate its borrowers. (Clements, Nick. "5 Reasons New Lenders Are Ignoring FICO Credit Scores". Forbes. Retrieved 2016-10-11.)

	They also offer cash management (checking) accounts and an investment platform that includes brokerage and robo-advisor services.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

	There is more than one trillion dollars of student debt in the U.S. today, making student loan debt the second largest amount of debt, second only to the $8.5 trillion owed in mortgages. Despite the gargantuan size of the market, there have traditionally been very few options: 90 percent of the loans are made by the government at standard 7 to 8 percent interest rates. (https://www.forbes.com/sites/advisor/2020/06/03/for-high-school-grads-during-covid-19-gap-year-takes-on-a-whole-new-meaning/#358316d116fe)

	SoFi (Social Financing) started as a small company with just one product, student loan refinancing. Today, the company offers a variety of products, but student loan refinancing is still its signature product. 

	In 2020, SoFi also is working to become a market leader in private student loans as well.
	Over the years, it has grown into the largest and most well known student loan refinancing lender. I personally attribute them to making student loan refinancing as mainstream as it is today. However, SoFi is not without it's growing pains, and it's hard to know if they are still the best with all the other competitors out there. (https://thecollegeinvestor.com/13740/sofi-review/)

	The 10th of the best student loan refinance companies:
	
	More than 250,000 borrowers have refinanced $18 billion in student loans with SoFi. It’s no wonder considering the company offers competitive interest rares, no fees, and flexible repayment terms.
	SoFi offers its student loan refinancing product to U.S. residents, permanent residents, and visa holders. (https://www.credible.com/blog/best-student-loan-refinance-companies/)
